# DevOps (Azure DevOps or GitHub)
## Everything as Code
For many years already we have the possibility to maintain any manual configuration, as code. 
However, we still click around and call it "production" months later. I call it "technical debt".
As people come and leave very often, there is a big chance that a manual change nobody knows about, is what keeps a company alive.
Let's steer away from that mentality and keep your intellectual property well separated on domains of interest, secure, versioned and backed up.
I can help you define a future-proof DevOps strategy, by separating artifacts that don't belong together and making logical room for configurations-as-code.
