# DevOps (Azure DevOps or GitHub)
## Everything as Code
For many years already we have the possibility to maintain any manual configuration, as code. 
However, we still click around and call it "production" months later. I call it "technical debt".
As people come and leave very often, there is a big chance that a manual change nobody knows about, is what keeps a company alive.
Let's steer away from that mentality and keep your intellectual property well separated on domains of interest, secure, versioned and backed up.
I can help you define a future-proof DevOps strategy, by separating artifacts that don't belong together and making logical room for configurations-as-code.

## DTAP / OTAP build
A true isolation between various environments must be as secure as your electrical wires in your home. Once they touch each other, there is a big risk of fire.
For each solution that your organization runs, there should be at least a non-production environment where people can safely develop, test, optimize, learn and ultimately "accept" it.
Your Acceptance environment is the Production of tomorrow and you need to be able to control and predict the day of tomorrow.
I have almost 20 years of experience in safely shipping software, fully automated, stage by stage, with rollback possibility.
Some services such as Entra ID, or the Microsoft 365 suite are indeed production only, but even there room can be made for trying things out.
For the rest, there is a possibility for automation. 
Don't wait and don't rely too much on retro-fitting.
