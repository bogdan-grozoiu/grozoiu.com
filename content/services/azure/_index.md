title : "Cloud Positive - Architect As A Service"
---

As an Architect, I design and deliver technology strategy to business organizations and coordinate engineering teams throughout implementation.  
In my practice, I strive to provide high levels of value in both Business and Technical Stragegy and I measure it through customer satisfaction and achievement of consensus.

My offering for Architect-As-A-Service is a very people orriented practice, instead of process or methodology oriented.  
I create technological strategies to serve and improve the life of people in their organizations and not to tick a box in a forgotten spreadseet.

I am not judging people, but highly question their strategy. I don't question the who, but the why.

My Azure Architecture practice is covering 3 main areas:

1. Solution Designing
    1. Envisioning
    2. LLD and HLD Designing
    3. Roadmapping
    4. Platform Landing Zone Strategy
    5. Solutions Landing Zone Stretegy
    6. Security posture targeting

2. Cloud Adoption Framework
    1. Getting started for adoption
    2. Strategy Definition
    3. Planning for execution
    4. Planning for readiness
    5. Workload migrations
    6. Innovation and Modernization
    7. Security
    8. Management
    9. Governance

3. Well Architected Framework
    1. Reliability
    2. Security
    3. Cost Optimization
    4. Operational Excellence
    5. Performance Efficiency

Apart from these domains of delivery that I offer on long term contract basis, I also offer as part of my practice, Office Hours for Architectural consultations.  
On a common recurrence or whenever needed, I discuss over Teams or offline, with your direct or indirect customer their most stringent architectural questions.

I am not re-inventing the wheel, but I make sure all its parts are tightly coupled and you have a smooth and positive cloud experience.
