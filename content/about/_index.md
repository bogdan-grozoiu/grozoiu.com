My name is Bogdan Grozoiu. 

This is my personal blog, its content and all opinions expressed here are my own and not those of my employer.
I blog about [Azure](/azure/), [DevOps](/devsecops/) and [corporate culture](/corplife/) (new articles are on their way). 
The articles in this blog are inspired by real-life scenarios and I am trying to keep them as practical as possible. I am also trying to keep the articles short and to the point.

I am Romanian and since 2018 I live in the Netherlands with my wife, Sorina, and now two cats ^.^
During my time off I enjoy riding my bike in the surroundings of my village or traveling to places with better weather.

I work as a Cloud Solution Architect for [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com) and I am part of the [Global Partner Solutions](https://partner.microsoft.com) organization.
In my role I am helping our partners to build and deliver solutions on Azure. I think I may call myself an industry and technology visionary with a passion for designing complex Cloud solutions.

It all starts with a dream or very often with a customer request and ends up with a solution that is deployed and managed on Azure.
On a daily base I work with a highly skilled technical community of our partners (CTOs, Enterprise and Lead Architects) and I collaborate with them to build solutions that are scalable, secure and cost effective.

I am passionate about Azure, very oppinionated and I love to share my knowledge with others. I am a strong believer in the power of automations and I am always looking for ways to remove redundant tasks. I am also a big fan of the DevSecOps culture and I always look for ways to optimize and strengthen the way we work.

I have the tendency to suggest innovative and competitive technologies and also the ability to start from a birds-eye view and dive deep into technical details until everything is clear and actionable.

I enjoy helping businesses continuously transform through state-of-the-art cloud technology and their success is my success.
